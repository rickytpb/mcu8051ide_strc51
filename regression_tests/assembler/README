MCU 8051 IDE built-in assembler regression testing
--------------------------------------------------

Directory testcases contains .in files used by RTE (Regression Testing
Environment) to formulate command line switches for assembler for each specific
test case. Each of these files posses one test case along with an .asm file with
the same base name as the .in file has. This .asm is be compiled by assembler
during the test and the resulting .hex and .lst files are be then compared to
their expected content, files .exp.hex and .exp.lst in the testcase directory.
Each file generated by the assembler is stored in directory named results. Each
file which is supposed to be compared to its .exp.<something> file is processed
by an AWK script before the file content comparison takes place. That allows to
alter the file in a almost any way. Each test case can have its own specific AWK
script to alter only its results and not others.
