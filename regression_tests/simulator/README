MCU 8051 IDE simulator engine regression testing
------------------------------------------------

Each .in file in the testcases directory is used by RTE (Regression Testing
Environment) to run specific test on the simulator. The .in file is first
processed by m4 macro-processor and then passed to the simulator command line
interface. Commands contained in the .in file are processed by the engine and
generated output is redirected into a file with the same base name as the .in
file has, but with extension .out . This .out file is located in directory named
results for comparison with an .exp file located in the same directory as the
.in file. See MCU 8051 IDE handbook for information about the simulator command
line interface and its commands, it is a long list.
