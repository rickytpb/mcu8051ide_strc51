TODO list for MCU 8051 IDE

* ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter)
* Full simulation of UART (including tools)
* Simulation of SPI
* Simulation of MCU power down modes
* PCA (Programmable Counter Array)
* New virtual HW: stepper motors, new displays, digital potentiometers
* New MCUs, possibly some from NXP and Mentor Graphics
* I2C based RTC(DS1307)
* EEPROM(AT24C02)
* ADC(MAX1036/11600)
* SPI based MAX7219
* CAN BASED PROTOCOLS
